### update-syscoin

This script fetches syscoin release binaries from github and installs them into /usr/bin/local. It will ask you for the release version you want to install. It will also ask you for your password, as it needs root privileges to write to /usr/local/bin. You can run it right from the repository like this:

`bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/einalex/syscoin-scripts/master/update-syscoin)`
